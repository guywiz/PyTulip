# PyTulip

## Work in progress

This folder contains code snippets that are not finalized, but mneat to be shared with colleagues. As soon as the classes or plugins are stabilized, they will move into other folders, Algoruthms, Import, etc.

Notes for Quentin

* The OneModeProjection placed here does something additional to the class that can be found in the Algorithms/OneModeProjection folder. The two mode graph containing substrate and catalyst nodes is projected onto a substrate-substrate one-mode graph. A property is created on edges to carry the different types of the catalyst nodes that give rise to the edge.
* Homogeneity computes two matrices (the entanglement matrices, as defined by Renoust) that are written dowbn on the disk.
