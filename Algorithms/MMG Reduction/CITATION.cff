abstract: >-
  The algorithm processes a multivariate multigraph (MMG),
  that is a graph with multiple weighted edges, where nodes
  and edges of various types (weights typically depend on
  types). Assume some nodes are of type "PERSON". The
  algorithm outputs a weighted social network between
  persons of the MMG. Although non-deterministic, the social
  network it computes is unique. The computation of weights
  is historicized: edges of the social network hold an
  arithmetic expression computed along the reduction of the
  MMG, allowing to recompute weights on-the-fly (varying
  weights associated to types in the MMG).
